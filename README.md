Homework - Week 4 - Monday
Posted by Tim Whitacre on Jun 23

You'll be working in groups of 2 as follows:
Brendan Stern & Katlyn Gabor
Josh Daniels & Taylor Smith
Terry Ross & Jonathan Dickerson
Michael Powell  & Thach Lee
Greeley Dawson & Laura Patti

Your task is to create a repository and push to it. You only need to include a Markdown (.md) file and write something up about a fictional product you would create if you had time. Write at least 10 different bullet points about possible features, bugs etc that you might experience. Have fun with this but make sure it makes sense. Then your partner will fork the repo, make some suggestions and then create a pull request.
Make sure you both create repos and you both fork each others repos
Make sure you make changes and submit a pull request
You will need to accept/deny the pull request (there should be no open requests by tomorrow)
Also make sure you are working on a branch and not master.
